# protoedit

Terminal-based [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) data files editor.

Ctrl+Up/Down - Navigate field of a message

F4 - Change field sort order. Four variants available:

 * Proto - field shown as in the order it written in the proto file. This is default mode.
 * Wire - field shown as it readed in the binary data file. In this mode shown only data realy readed from the file (no default values).
 * Name - filed sorted by its name.

## Limits

In the current version, the program may slow down with files larger than 10 thousand data items.

## Examples

There are several example data files for testing the application in the 'data' folder.
Type `protoedit filename.pb` to open a file (or `cargo run --release -- data/filename.pb`).

 * ints.pb - simple integer data example
 * str.pb - multiline string example
 * bytes.pb - a field with 1000 random bytes
 * mega.pb - 1 million random values in three-level structures
 * test_data_1.pb - simple nested data example
